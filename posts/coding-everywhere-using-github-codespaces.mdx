This week I had to stay in my parents home but for some reason I didn’t bring my own computer with me, I wanned to do some codes but I didn’t want to install VSCode, Git and Node in my brother’s computer so I remembered there was a way to code and run my code even without install it on the machine, via Github Codespaces, so this is what I’m going to show you now, let’s go.

## Setup

As you see, the tool we are talking about is Github Codespaces, it does mean that our project has to be in Github, this is required.

So the first step to setup the Codespaces, you need to access the project repository in Github and click on “Code” > “Codespaces” > “Create codespace on main”

A new tab with a web version of VSCode should be opened.

Now we are ready to code, this VSCode is hosted in Github cloud machine and we can code, execute terminal commands and even run the project in it.

## Running the project

In my case, I was working on a NextJS project, so what I’m going to do at this point is to install the project dependencies by the command “yarn” in terminal.

![Yarn install dependencies](/images/coding-everywhere-using-github-codespaces/yarn-install-dependencies.png)

The command node, npm, yarn, npx and etc are pre-installed during the setup of Codespaces based on auto detections of project’s structure and files, so we don’t have to worry about them.

After installed the dependencies, just run the command “yarn dev” to run the project in dev mode.

Once the project is running, it will popup a message asking you to open the running project in a new tab, so click it and be happy with your environment ready to play.

Since it’s a NextJS project, you can simply editing a page and save it, the result will automatically be replied to the opened tab, if you are running other kind of projects, a rebuild command may be needed.

So that’s it! now we have a completaly environment to code and run our project in any computer and without install any software locally but a web browser.
