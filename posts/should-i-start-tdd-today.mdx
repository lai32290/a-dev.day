As a developer, probably you’ve already heard many and many times people talking about terms like automated tests, unit test and specially TDD, Test Driven Development, they are considered a very important step of the development workflow.

I don’t have any different opinion about it, there’s no doubt tests are super important and it can really increase your code quality.

So this post I’m talking about TDD, Test Driven Development is basically saying that you have to create test before you code the implementation and it can bring many advantages

* You can guarantee your code is covered by test, since you made it at first.
* You code can be easier, because you only have to make the test pass, it can avoid over engineering.
* You are sure the implementation is really works in the way that you expected
* You can finish the task faster because you intend to do the easiest way.

Maybe you can see many other advantages and I believe that you are right. So should I start learn TDD right now?

Actually, all of these things bellow are what I thought, until the day that I’m really able to do TDD in my daily works, so I figured out why I had so many questions about TDD and why I couldn’t implement it until that moment.

As a good developer, I tried to follow the “best practices” what people say, so I tried to TDD every time that I’m creating tests, even it probably takes more time than if I create the test after, because my axe wasn’t shaped enough, I wasn’t familiar enough with the automation test library yet (Jasmine, at that moment).

So when my tests fails, I’m not sure which part of the code is wrong, did I made the test wrongly? Or my implementation is really having an unexpected behavior? My tests makes me feel not confident with my code, which’s ironic.

I took so long to figured out that I should not TDD yet, but should keep creating tests until I became good at it and confident that I can create tests correctly.

There’s no how to improve a skill if you don’t even have it.

So if you’re in the same situation like me before, just take easy, be nice with yourself, keep creating tests and once you stop juggling with your testing library, so it’s the time to go back to your TDD and to not get frustrated, I hope this post can help you.
