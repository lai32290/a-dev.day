  title: Getting previews sibling element in CSS

A few days ago, when I was surfing on my Facebook, I saw someone asking for how to make a navigation menu, which the navigation menu has blue background, except the active one, but the preview and next active link also has a rounded border corner, looks something like this.

So I thought “ha, this is easy to do with some CSS” and then I started to make it in order to help that person.

I started at creating the backgrounded menu and an active link, nothing special:

```jsx
<ul>
  <li><a href="#">Home</a></li>
  <li class="active"><a href="#">About us</a></li>
  <li><a href="#">Service</a></li>
  <li><a href="#">Contact</a></li>
</ul>

<style>
  ul {
    list-style: none;
  }
  li {
    background-color: blue;
  }
  li.active {
    background-color: transparent;
  }
</style>
```

The code above will result something similar to this:

![Result of navigation menu](/images/getting-previews-sibling-element-in-css/step1.png)

So let’s add some rounded corner, starting with the “next link”, the easiest one:

```jsx
<style>
  .active + li {
    border-top-right-radius: 10px;
  }
</style>
```

This code works nice, now I just need to revert the selector, like `li .active` to achieve the same result for the “previews” one, correct? No!

In the beginning I thought it was so easy to make because I thought it only needs to revert the selector to achieve the same result, but the selector `li .active` is actually targeting the active one, instead of the previews one.

After a few search, here it is the correct selector:

```jsx
<style>
  li:has(+ .active) {
    border-bottom-right-radius: 10px;
  }
</style>
```

This selector is going to search for `li` element which has `.active` element as next sibling, and this is what I want.
