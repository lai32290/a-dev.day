    title: Why I don’t focus on only one program language?

If you ask me “what language do you code?”, my answer is going to be Javascript, since I spend most of my daily time on it during my last 7 years of career, surely it’s my main programming language, it’s what I’m more familiar with and it’s also what pay my bills, but it doesn’t mean that I’m making every single side project of my in Javascript.

When I need to make an automation script to do a bunch of things, probably I’m going to use Javascript, just because of I’m more familiar with it.

Once I tried to make a game automation, I had the script to control my keyboard and mouse based on image on my screen, so I run to Python, because it has more powerful libraries to do that.

Some of my side projects are mobile app, I used to make them in React Native but I’m slightly changing to Flutter because I feel it more stable and UX is better.

If you ask me to a website and you’d like to manage the content by yourself, WordPress is on the top of my list.

Making game? Unity 3D and Godot are going to be my choices, depends on what kind of game I’m making.

Since my favorite code editor is NeoVim, I started to learn Lua because NeoVim can be configured using it.

I see programming languages, frameworks and libraries as tools and I wouldn’t like to have only hammer, pliers, screwdriver or any other single tool in my tool box, as people said, *if you have hammer everything looks like nail*, I like to learn and explore new languages in order to know something more fit to different situations.

For sure you really need to have a flagship because it’s very important for you to have a stable job and money income, but don’t limit yourself, you don’t need to be loyal with any tool, non of them is better than others, learning when to use which one of them will make your developer’s life easier and funnier.
